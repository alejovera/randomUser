## Using Random User API
In this Web App, I get the information from the API using fetch.
Also I implemented a React Context to utilize the data directly, and not passing from component to component.
### Deployment 
This Web App was deployed on Firebase. It's a simple and fast way to put your project online, so it can be easily accessible.
### Funcionting
You can click on a User's Card to see all the personal information. If you go directly to an URL that doesn't exist, it redirects you to the Home Page.
